# Sleep-Efficiency-Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to provide personalized recommendations for optimizing sleep efficiency based on user input, such as sleep duration, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, caffeine intake, number of awakenings, and exercise frequency. The app uses a form to collect data from the user and offers tailored suggestions for improving sleep quality and overall well-being.

## Features

- **Sleep Duration**: Recommends sleep habits based on the user's sleep duration.
- **Alcohol Consumption**: Gives insights based on low or high alcohol consumption.
- **Smoking**: Provides tailored advice for smokers vs. non-smokers.
- **Awakenings**: Offers recommendations for users experiencing frequent awakenings.
- **Caffeine Intake**: Provides suggestions based on high or low caffeine intake.
- **Exercise Frequency**: Recommends sleep practices based on exercise frequency.
- **Reset Button**: Allows users to reset the form and start over.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for interactive UI
- **Backend**: Python for processing and logic
- **Data Handling**: Pandas (if needed for processing or analysis)
- **Other Libraries**: 
  - Streamlit for UI components
  - Any other libraries used for data processing (e.g., NumPy, Pandas)
